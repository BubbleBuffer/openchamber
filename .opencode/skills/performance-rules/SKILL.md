description: Use when modifying Zustand stores, SSE/event handlers, polling, scroll/DOM logic, optimistic updates, autosizing inputs, list ordering, in-memory caches, or any high-frequency React render path. These rules exist because violating them has caused measurable regressions (render cascades, memory bloat, UI jank).

## Overview

These rules apply to all UI and sync layer work where state changes frequently or fans out to many subscribers. Each rule has caused a real regression in this codebase.

If your change does not touch stores, SSE, polling, scroll/DOM, optimistic updates, list ordering, or memo'd hot paths, you do not need to follow this skill end-to-end — but the regression-prevention checklist in `AGENTS.md` still applies.

## Shared-store render discipline

- **Treat common stores as render fanout boundaries.** An unnecessary reference change in shared state can re-render large parts of the app.
- **Do not put high-frequency state in broadly consumed stores.** Fast-changing state should live in narrow stores with narrow subscribers.
- **Update only the fields that changed.** Preserve references for untouched state branches.
- **Prefer leaf selectors over container selectors.** Subscribe to the smallest stable value that satisfies the component.
- **Isolate hot consumers.** If a value changes often and only a few components need it, move it to a narrower store or consume it in a memoized child.
- **Do not subscribe shell/layout components to broad live collections.** If a shell only needs one field, entity, or derived flag, subscribe to that instead of the whole collection.
- **Treat provider roots as global hot paths.** A top-level provider must not subscribe to high-frequency data unless the feature is actually enabled and the subscription is essential.

## Zustand referential equality

Zustand skips re-renders when a selector returns the same reference (`Object.is`). Every new object/array reference triggers a re-render in every subscriber.

- **Never spread all state fields in an update.** Only create new references for fields that actually changed. A `message.part.delta` event should not clone `session`, `permission`, etc.
- **Select leaf values, not containers.** `useStore((s) => s.permission[sessionID])` is correct. `useStore((s) => s.permission)` subscribes to every permission change across all sessions.
- **Preserve references when merging.** If prepending older messages, keep existing message object references. Only add truly new items. Return the original array if nothing was added.
- **For derived collections, preserve item identity when presentation-relevant fields are unchanged.** Reuse previous item references for unchanged rows/items and move high-frequency live fields to narrow per-item selectors.

## Store splitting

A single store with N properties means every subscriber re-evaluates on every state change. Split stores by change frequency and subscriber set.

- **Group state by how often it changes.** Streaming state (updated 60/sec) must not live with user preferences (updated on click).
- **Group state by who reads it.** If only 2 components need a value, it belongs in a store that only those 2 subscribe to.
- **Cross-store reads use `.getState()`.** Actions in one store that need another store call `useOtherStore.getState()` — imperative, no subscription.
- **Never add unrelated state to an existing store** just because it's convenient. Create a new store.

## Event pipeline and SSE

- **Gate expensive operations on the hot path.** During streaming, `message.part.delta` and `message.part.updated` fire ~60/sec. Any `findIndex`, `filter`, or iteration added to these handlers multiplies across every event. Gate behind a cheap boolean check first (e.g., check `next[0]` before scanning the array).
- **Skip no-op updates.** If an incoming event doesn't change the state (same role, same finish, same timestamps), return `false` from the reducer to avoid creating new references.
- **Coalesce by key.** Same-entity events (e.g., repeated `session.status` for the same session) should replace earlier ones in the queue, not accumulate.
- **Preserve event ordering semantics.** Reducers and queues must not let stale deltas or out-of-order events corrupt the latest state.
- **Do not widen live-activity fallbacks.** A fallback for delayed status should inspect only the current trailing entity, not arbitrary historical records.

## Polling payload fidelity

- **Do not let lightweight polling erase rich fields.** If light mode omits fields (e.g., `diffStats`), preserve previous rich data until a heavy follow-up fetch lands.
- **Use two-phase polling.** Run cheap change detection first; only run heavy status fetches for directories that actually changed.

## Optimistic updates

- **Use the shadow Map pattern.** Insert optimistic data into the store for instant UI, AND register it in a separate tracking Map. Cleanup happens deterministically via `mergeOptimisticPage` on the next data fetch — not via heuristics in the event reducer.
- **Pass client-generated IDs to the server.** Use the same ID format as the server (hex-encoded timestamps). Pass `messageID` to `promptAsync` so the server echoes back the same ID. This prevents duplicates and enables in-place replacement.
- **Rollback on error.** Remove the optimistic entry from both the store and the shadow Map.
- **Stabilize bridge callbacks.** When wiring hook callbacks into module-level refs, use stable ref wrappers so effects do not loop on changing function identities.

## Session/input consistency

- **Capture send config at queue time.** Queue items must include provider/model/agent/variant snapshot; do not re-resolve from mutable live state at send time.
- **Keep server-selected attachments sendable.** Preserve server-backed file selections in queue/submit flows and convert them to proper `file://` URLs before sending.
- **Do not let text input state repaint unrelated chrome.** Typing should not force unrelated controls, menus, indicators, or toolbars to re-render on every keystroke.
- **Extract slow-changing chrome from hot input paths.** If controls do not depend on the current text value, move them behind memoized boundaries with stable callbacks.

## Bootstrap resilience

- **Treat startup 502/503 as transient.** Retry bootstrap/session-list flows with bounded retries/intervals, especially in VS Code where API readiness can lag bridge startup.
- **Use polling recovery when failures are swallowed.** If an async loader resolves without throwing on failure, recover with interval retries gated by loaded-state checks.

## Scroll and DOM

- **Never use `await waitForFrames()` for scroll preservation.** Frames of visible scroll jump are unacceptable. Use `useLayoutEffect` to adjust scroll synchronously after React commits DOM — before the browser paints.
- **Capture scroll state before the state change, restore in layout effect.** The pattern: save `scrollHeight`/`scrollTop` into a ref before triggering the update, consume it in `useLayoutEffect` on the rendered output.
- **Do not let viewport resizes masquerade as content growth.** Viewport-height changes must not trigger the same scroll compensation logic used for actual content growth.
- **Disable or narrow native/browser scroll anchoring when custom scroll logic exists.** Browser anchoring and app-managed pinning/follow logic will fight and produce jiggle.
- **Autosize textareas without transient collapse on growth.** Avoid `height='auto'` shrink/expand cycles on every character when the content only grew; this creates visible layout bounce.

## List ordering and view consistency

- **Do not sort structural lists directly from high-churn live fields.** If live updates are frequent, sorting directly from them causes reorder thrash and wide rerender cascades.
- **If live recency is required, freeze order during high-frequency updates and apply a one-shot reorder only at an intentional lifecycle edge.** Choose the lifecycle edge explicitly instead of letting every intermediate update reshuffle the UI.
- **Use one ordering source for all views of the same data.** Different views of the same entities must derive from the same ranked list or rank map; do not let each surface re-derive ordering independently.
- **Do not mix global snapshots and local live snapshots without an explicit reconciliation policy.** If multiple data sources feed one view, define which fields win and how they merge.

## Component isolation

- **Extract high-frequency hook consumers into separate components.** If a hook re-evaluates 60/sec (e.g., streaming status), wrap its consumer in a `React.memo` child component so the parent doesn't re-render.
- **Use custom `React.memo` comparators for message rows.** Compare render-relevant fields (role, finish, parts count, part IDs) — not object references.

## Caching and memory

- **Cap in-memory caches with both count and byte limits.** Entry count alone doesn't prevent memory bloat from large files. Use dual-constraint LRU (e.g., 40 entries OR 20MB).
- **Set store session limits to match loaded data.** If bootstrap loads N sessions, set `limit >= N`. Otherwise the next SSE event triggers trimming that silently removes sessions.
- **Invalidate caches on mutations.** File content cache must clear entries on write, delete, rename. Prefetch cache must clear on session eviction.
- **Use TTLs to prevent redundant fetches.** If a session was fetched <15s ago, skip re-fetching — SSE events keep it current.

## Directory context

- **Never cache directory strings in closures.** Directory can change at any time (worktree switch). Read it dynamically from `opencodeClient.getDirectory()` at call time.
- **Pass directory hints when the source of truth isn't available yet.** Newly created sessions aren't in the sync store until SSE delivers them. Pass the known directory as a parameter instead of relying on lookup.
